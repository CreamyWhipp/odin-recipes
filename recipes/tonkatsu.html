    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For those of you who are new to this Japanese dish, tonkatsu consists of tender pork loin (or fillet) that has been breaded and deep-fried to crunchy perfection. The word Ton (豚) comes from “pork” and Katsu (カツ) is an abbreviation of Katsuretu (カツレツ), derived from the English word “cutlet.”</p>
    <p>Like many other popular foods in Japan (think ramen, tempura, soba, etc.), there are tonkatsu restaurants that exclusively serve this juicy pork cutlet as their specialty. And no plate of tonkatsu is ever complete without a mound of freshly shredded cabbage and a healthy drizzle of tonkatsu sauce.</p>
    <p>Tonkatsu is said to be inspired by the French dish, côtelette de veau, which is essentially breaded veal cutlet pan-fried in butter. One Tokyo restaurant called Rengatei 煉瓦亭 (still open today!) took this concept and made a few changes to appeal to the Japanese palette, and in 1899, Tonkatsu made its debut.</p>
