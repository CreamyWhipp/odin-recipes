    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This may come as a surprise, but Japanese Curry aka Curry Rice (Kare Raisu, カレーライス) is an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan. I grew up on curry rice as my mom would make it as frequently as I can recall.</p>
    <p>The bite-sized chunks of meat, the thick-cut vegetables, the rich and creamy brown curry sauce, and the fluffy rice are what makes every bite so comforting and exciting to eat. Not only is it a meal that’s easy to make on busy nights, but it also tastes better the second day.</p>
