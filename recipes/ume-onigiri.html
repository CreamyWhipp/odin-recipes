    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Plum Rice Ball is a triangle-shaped rice ball made of steamed white rice, chopped pickled plums, and sesame seeds, and cloaked in a sheet of dried nori seaweed.</p>
    <p>Umeboshi (梅干し) is a savory Japanese pickled ume plum and it’s eaten as a condiment or accompaniment for a bowl of rice, similar to tsukemono pickles or furikake rice seasoning.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Japanese short grain rice</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Umeboshi</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Nori</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Remove and discard the seeds from pickled plums.</li>
        <li>Mince the plums with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped pickled plums and sesame seeds to the steamed rice.</li>
        <li>With a rice paddle, mix well together using a cutting motion. Don’t make it mushy. Roughly divide the rice into 6 or 8 equal portions.</li>
        <li>Prepare a bowl of water and a bowl of kosher salt. Wet both hands and then dip 2 fingertips in the salt and spread between your palms.</li>
        <li>Scoop the rice onto your palm. Gently press and form the rice into a triangle. I use three fingers (thumb, index finger, middle finger) to make a triangle corner.</li>
        <li>When you press, your hands should be just firm enough so the rice ball doesn’t fall apart. You don’t want to squeeze the rice too tight.</li>
        <li>Wrap the rice ball with nori seaweed. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
